# Project : Sealdrive


# ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement
Data storage and accessibility are critical in a decentralized environment, yet most existing solutions rely heavily on centralized servers or require the entire network's availability for data retrieval. This dependency poses a significant challenge, especially in scenarios where a majority (2/3) of the network is down, leading to potential data loss or delayed access.

SealDrive aims to revolutionize on-chain storage by providing a decentralized, resilient, and highly accessible storage solution. Leveraging the Walrus protocol, SealDrive ensures that user data remains retrievable even when 2/3 of the network is offline, addressing the following challenges:

- Data Resilience: Ensuring that uploaded data is securely stored and remains retrievable despite partial network failures.
- Decentralized Access: Eliminating reliance on centralized entities while maintaining seamless data access for users.
- Network Downtime Tolerance: Building a system robust enough to provide uninterrupted access, even under extreme network partition scenarios.
- Scalability: Accommodating growing user demands and large data volumes without compromising performance or reliability.
- User Experience: Delivering a user-friendly interface akin to Google Drive while maintaining the security and privacy benefits of blockchain technology.

# ðŸš€ Key Features
- Sui Ecosystem Integration: Users can log in using Sui Wallet or any wallet within the Sui ecosystem, ensuring secure and seamless authentication.
- Built on Walrus Protocol:
    - Optimized storage with just 4-5 replicas for efficient data redundancy.
Guaranteed data retrieval, 
    - even if 2/3 of the network is down.
- Wallet-to-Wallet Media Sharing: A unique feature that enables users to share files directly with other Sui users, enhancing peer-to-peer collaboration.
- Decentralized & Efficient: Combines the advantages of decentralization with reliable, cost-effective storage.
- User-Friendly Interface: Familiar, intuitive design inspired by Google Drive, tailored for Web3 users.




# ðŸ’ª Challenges Faced

Managing filestreams in a decentralized system was a significant challenge. Unlike traditional centralized solutions where data streams can be directly controlled and processed, SealDrive had to ensure smooth streaming, chunking, and reassembly of files across a distributed network. This
